Welcome to the wonderful world of building chatbots!

We will assume you already have Node and NPM installed. To use SuperScript you need to make sure you have Node 0.12.x installed. Later version do not work yet.

You can start by cloneing this repo locally using the command 
`git clone https://github.com/silentrob/hello-superscript.git`

You will then want to run `npm install` This will load in all the dependencies. 

This example will show you how to create a basic trigger, topic and plugin, and use 2 sample clients. (Telnet and Slack)
